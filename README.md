> loomin is currently configured for our use... atleast for now though
> So like, as loomin gets updated more, i could add compatibility for other stuff. like roblox OAuth or somethin

# TODO
- [ ] cleaner api and faster responses (which means reducing dumb processes that could take a while), aswell as a documentation for it
- [ ] make all pages be managable by anyone online (kinda.. maybe???)
  - SOFA TOLD ME DISCORD OAUTH WORKS ON DETA SO YEAH USE DISCORD OAUTH FUTURE NYX
- [ ] better frontend (and not trash)
- [ ] cool modern editor for loomin (for all pages, fixed editor)
- [ ] use deta env variables to configure the server (maybe)
- [ ] all edits by users can be public
- [ ] better syntaxer (make it smart like the normal ones we have around)

# sum notes for the people who wants to host one when done i think
> [!NOTE]
> The wiki content is rendered with Jinja along with Jinki (my own syntaxer) so you have to make your own html code (for the frontend) and have jinja with it. although the code will be an easy copy paste lol

> [!NOTE]
> jinki converts syntaxes from normal jinji format (whatever you make it do) to html code (which you can customize) so be aware of that

> [!NOTE]
> Saving edits can either be saved with or without a discord account. depending on the wiki's configuration
> Saving with a discord account is cool since you can just add trusted accounts by their discord id and have the edits published immediately

> [!NOTE]
> Loomin uses the set github repo to read/write information to your wiki! so any changes you make in the wiki will take usually a minute.

> [!NOTE]
> Yes, hosting loomin all by yourself pretty much costs almost nothing.
> I'm not sure about that since free hosts tend to just become not free after a while. althooough i could try makin this compatible to vercel too! (if i can even get it working on my first try, which i unfortunately failed many times.)
